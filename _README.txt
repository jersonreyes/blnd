[DESCRIPTION]
Introducing BLND
Discover a new way — BLND is an automated answering system developed for 
AMA Blended Learning users which can be accessed anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

GET EARLY ACCESS:

I made the website to share a fair play on AMA students. I know that there are unprivileged people out there who is battling 
with financial problems, those who have no access to any computers, or if by a chance, even if they do, they have no technical knowledge 
in doing so. On the other side, there are even those AMA campus computers that can't even run Microsoft Word. For that reason, I spent time 
making and designing the whole system so, make the most out of it. — It is not AMA server's fault that it keeps crashing at days of deadline. 
Students, please get off with the rant. We also encountered this before. This was from the cause of students' cramming issues. 
So answer your exams, quizzes, periodical exams in an advance to prevent all of this from happening. 
There are 21 subjects included. Instructions are also included at first visit. Share this to help other people - Jerson Reyes
